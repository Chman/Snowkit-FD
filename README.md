snowkit templates for FlashDevelop
==================================

See [snowkit](https://snowkit.org/).

Instructions
------------

You'll need the [latest development build](http://flashdevelop.org/downloads/builds/) of FlashDevelop.

Download the [SnowkitTemplate.fdz](https://github.com/Chman/Snowkit-FD/raw/master/SnowkitTemplate.fdz) file and execute it or drag'n'drop it into FlashDevelop. Restart FlashDevelop to finish the installation.

Update
------

Make sure you remove the previous snowkit templates before updating as they will mess up everything. These are located in `c:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\FlashDevelop\Projects\` (replace `USERNAME` with your windows login name).
